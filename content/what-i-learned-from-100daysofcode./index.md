Hello there, I am a senior student at the School of Information Technology, King Mongkut‚Äôs University of Technology Thonburi (**KMUTT**). Bangkok, Thailand.

I have a chance to talk in a lightning session for about ~15 minutes with this topic at [**YWC Programming Meetup #6**](https://ywc.in.th). I want to keep it as my memory and share with your guys‚Äô.

It‚Äôs started when I joined the **XConf Thailand 2019** by **ThoughtWorks Thailand**, what I got from this event is the inspiration from the speakers and attendees.

In the other hands, what I worry is that **why I so damn noob**. It always happens when I compare myself with other people (speaker and some attendees). Moreover, I also ask myself why everyone is awesome? Why I am just a little guy? I have to do something!!

But I know that I am just undergrad student, while they are the professional (maybe 5 yr. + experience). So, I think it just simply that they gonna be greater than me. BUT I wanna be better!!!

I told me to do something, otherwise, I gonna be left behind.

I started to do something. I listed what I am good and not good at. Which one that I have gets hands in. Which one I have not tried before?

What‚Äôs next? I found some tweet of [Kan Ouivirach](https://medium.com/u/6f6af3cc17e7) from [Pronto Marketing](https://www.prontomarketing.com/). He was writing his diary as‚Ä¶.

That was the beginning of the #100DaysofCode challenge officially.

> Anyway, If you search through my twitter account, you might think that I **LIE** because the **#100DaysofCode** tweet has started on 21 Apr 2019. Actually, I started before that just for fun. XConf Thailand 2019 is the gamechanger, it made me serious about **#100DaysofCode** again. That‚Äôs why the first tweet is not the first day.

### What is #100DaysofCode¬†?

It is the online challenge in the software developer community that challenges you to do coding an hour a day _for 100 days_ and tweet your progress _every day_ with the **#100DaysofCode**. It‚Äôs simple right? Yep! It simple just like that! LOL

![#100DaysOfCode Official Website‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää[https://www.100daysofcode.com/](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)](./asset-3.png)

**AND** don‚Äôt forget to like some **#100DaysofCode** tweet at least from 2 people every day. Everyone deserves encouragement¬†: )

Moreover, they also suggest creating the Github repo and commit your progress every day‚Ä¶ But in my opinion, I did it sometimes because I read a textbook or watching some talks from the tech conference on YouTube instead of coding.

If you want to get more detail about **#100DaysOfCode**, this video will tell you in more detail. Cheers!

### My key takeaways from #100DaysOfCode

I started the challenge 22 days ago (14 May 2019, when I was writing this article). I learn a lot! Especially The technical skill.

**_Kotlin, Test Driven Development (TDD), Spring Boot with Kotlin, Gredle, Dependencies Injection/Inversion, Ktor, Detekt, Google App Engine, VIM, Clojurescript_**

One thing that I got from doing this challenge is **‚ÄúHabit‚Äù**. I think it very benefited for me. I was so intense in this challenge. One day I didn‚Äôt do the challenge, I can‚Äôt sleep. So, I MUST get up from my bed and going to read some book or watch tech conference from YouTube.

In the first week, there is nothing changed much. But almost a month passed, I listed what I have learned so far. **OMG**! There are a lot!!! I am so proud of myself.

Another thing that I am thinking of is I did this challenge together with people from around the world, everyone is **_‚Äúlearning from each othe_r‚Äù**. They are telling what they have learned, so the knowledge will be accumulated and being an ingredient for building a better future. _I think it awesome!_

This challenge made me see many people that doing HTML, CSS, Javascript‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämade me to celebrity in software developer society will be breaking out their skill limit.

Let‚Äôs think about it. One day we will see the programmer practicing what they didn‚Äôt use before and we can say hi and be a friend‚Ä¶

_‚ÄúHey I have used this language before, I have some tutorial that might be useful for you. Don‚Äôt worry!! It‚Äôs very easy to understand. I hope it will help you. Just try~‚Äù_

_‚ÄúHey, Are you try to use this tool? How was it? Does it solve the XXX problem? How it different from the other one? Can you tell me?‚Äù_

When I imagine the whole-world programmers‚Äô community that contributes and share what they have learned together and also help the beginner who doesn‚Äôt know where to start. Helping each other make our community stronger and be better every day. ~ _It‚Äôs gonna be fun so much!_

### Last but not¬†least.

I hope this article will get you to know **#100DaysOfCode** more with some of my experience that will be an inspiration for other people just like me when I participated in XConf Thailand 2019.

Personally, I have done 22 days so far. It is going to be more intense and I have lots of things that I want to practice within this challenge.

What I have listed are **Refactoring Technique, Clean Code, Code Smells, Design Patterns, Cloud Native, Microservices, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), more Testing, more Data Structure, more Algorithms** and anything that will be made me be a better programmer in the future.

I will be share with you guys‚Äô again when I have done 100 days. Thank you, everyone, for reading till here~

Now, I will leave it from here, I am going to practice writing the configuration for vim ~

Thanks all.
